\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to start by thanking everyone that is not explicitly mentioned in this acknowledgement, but still has brightened my days the last couple of years.
Every brilliant researcher I have met during travels, all students I have had the pleasure of teaching, and all friends I have made over the years; thank you all for everything.
In particular, this extends to everyone that I have had the fortune of meeting through the Department of Automatic Control.
The people at the department is the reason why I pursued a PhD in the first place and despite not mentioning everyone here, I cannot thank you all enough.

A special thank you is extended to my supervisor and dear friend, Martina.
I will never be able to thank you enough for everything you have done for me over the years.
