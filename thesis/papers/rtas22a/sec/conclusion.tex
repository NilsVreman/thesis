In this paper, we have proposed a novel adaptive implementation scheme for real-time embedded controllers, aiming to increase their robustness to arbitrary patterns of deadline misses. 
The approach adapts a general, predesigned linear controller according to the number of consecutive deadline overruns.
No additional assumptions are made on the predesigned controller or the plant model, and only minimal requirements are put on the control task (Logical Execution Time) and the real-time operating system (late tasks being killed).
The adaptation scheme can be implemented without any additional complexity or design overhead, hence strengthening the industrial applicability.
Additionally, we extend the state-of-the-art by considering dynamic controllers.

To analyse our controller implementation, we developed a probabilistic approach.
With said approach, it is possible to leverage a plant model and a probabilistic model of deadline misses to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive controller.
We complement this average-case analysis with a worst-case stability analysis based on JSR.
We used both approaches to evaluate the controller on both a physical plant and a considerable number of simulated plants from the literature on process control.
The results show that our adaptive controller implementation consistently improves system performance and robustness to deadline misses.
