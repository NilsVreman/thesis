\paper[Stability under Extended Weakly-Hard Constraints]{Stability of Linear Control Systems under Extended Weakly-Hard Constraints}
\authors{Nils Vreman \and Paolo Pazzaglia \and Victor Magron \and Jie Wang \and Martina Maggio}

\begin{abstract}
    Control systems can show robustness to many events, like disturbances and model inaccuracies.
    It is natural to speculate that they are also robust to sporadic deadline misses when implemented as digital tasks on an embedded platform.
    This paper proposes a comprehensive stability analysis for control systems subject to deadline misses, leveraging a new formulation to describe the patterns experienced by the control task under different handling strategies.
    Such analysis brings the assessment of control systems robustness to computational problems one step closer to the controller implementation.
