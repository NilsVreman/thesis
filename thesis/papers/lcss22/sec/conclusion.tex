This paper proposes a switching stability analysis framework for control systems subject to weakly-hard constraints.
The existing weakly-hard models are extended by introducing the choice of deadline handling strategy as part of the model.
The paper provides:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item an analytic bound on the switching stability for control systems subject to a set of constraints, relating the hardness of the implementation to the stability of the system, and
    \item a decoupled framework where the real-time implementation and control stability analysis can be performed separately.
\end{enumerate*}
We applied the analysis to multiple examples, with different dynamics and implementations, to show the wide applicability of the approach.
