This paper proposes a switching stability analysis framework for LTI systems with arbitrary weakly-hard constraints, extending the weakly-hard model and providing an analytic stability bound.
The analysis allows us to assess whether computational errors (present in industrial controllers) affect the stability of the controlled systems.
Future work will focus on the performance loss due to the presence of deadline misses following the extended weakly-hard model.
