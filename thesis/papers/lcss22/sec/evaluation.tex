We apply the lifted dynamics model presented in Section~\ref{sec:stability} to a representative plant for the process industry, controlled using a PI-controller, sampled with $\Ts = 0.5$~s:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        \plant & : &\begin{cases}
            x_{k+1} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                0.606 & 0.304 & 0.076 \\
                0 & 0.606 & 0.304 \\
                0 & 0 & 0.606 \\
            \end{bmatrix} x_k + \begin{bmatrix}
                0.014 \\
                0.091 \\
                0.394 \\
            \end{bmatrix} u_k \\
            y_k &= \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} x_k
        \end{cases}\\
        \ctrler & : &\begin{cases}
            z_{k+1} &= z_k + 0.359 y_k \\
            u_{k+1} &= 0.454 z_k + 0.633 y_k.  
        \end{cases}
    \end{array}
\end{equation*}
We analyse the stability of the control systems subject to different $\elcssanymiss{}{\strat}$ constraints.
We consider all combinations of strategy (\tK{} or \tS{}) and actuator mode (\tZ{} or \tH{}).
%
For each combination, we generate the lifted set $\Alifted_{\lambda^\strat}$. Its JSR $\rho \left( \Alifted_{\lambda^\strat} \right)$ is then approximated using three different algorithms.
First, a lower and upper bound of $\rho \left( \Alifted_{\lambda^\strat} \right)$ is computed using the \code{JSR toolbox}~\cite{vankeerberghen2014jsr}.
Then, an upper bound of the JSR is obtained via SOS relaxations, using both the \emph{dense} and \emph{sparse} algorithm from \code{SparseJSR}~\cite{sparsejsr}.

Table~\ref{table:stable} displays our results, acquired on an Intel Core i5-8265U@1.60GHz CPU with 8GB RAM.
Lower and upper bounds are denoted ``LB'' and ``UB''. 
All upper bounds obtained with \code{JSR toolbox} was found greater than the ones obtained with SOS, thus omitted from the Table.
The symbol ``$-$'' means that the SDP solver runs out of memory.
%
The SDP solver in \code{SparseJSR} uses a second-order method.
Thus, a different solver (utilising a first-order method) could reduce memory usage at the cost of potential accuracy loss.
Bold values represent stable systems under their corresponding \ewhc{}, strategy, and actuator mode.
Starred values represent stable systems inferred from Corollary~\ref{cor:rho_dominance_mk}.
%
The \code{JSR toolbox} provides an accurate lower bound and a coarse upper bound.
In contrast, the dense SOS method finds a better upper bound but takes more time.
We compare the time to run both SOS methods, indicating with ``$\times$'' the speedup factor to obtain the sparse bound w.r.t.~the dense.

All the upper bounds computed by \code{JSR toolbox} are greater than 1, while all lower bounds are \emph{below} 1, thus we cannot draw any conclusion using the \code{JSR toolbox}.
For all \ewhc{}, $\elcssanymiss{}{\strat}$ where $x=1$ and $2 < \ell \leq 6$ the SOS upper bounds allow us to infer that the system is stable for all combinations of strategy and actuator mode, and also for $\ell=2$ under the \tS{} strategy.
From Theorem~\ref{th:rho_dominance_general}, the stability will hold also for all constraints that are harder to satisfy; in particular, Corollary~\ref{cor:rho_dominance_mk} implies stability for all $\elcssanymiss{}{\strat}$ with $x=1$ and $\ell>6$.
The speedup ratio is growing when $\ell$ increases, yielding a particularly high benefit of exploiting sparsity for \tSZ{}.
