In this section, I'll try to portray my ``elevator pitch''.

\textbf{Pitch:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{item:pitch1} What is the problem this thesis is trying to solve?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The hardware and system architecture is getting more powerful.
            \item This increases the complexity of the designed system and increases the error probability.
            \item Especially since more and more junior developers can use this powerful and complicated hardware for their designs.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Why is the problem an important one to analyse?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This can introduce huge risks in safety critical systems, risking lives and damage to humans
            \item Can cause major damage on infrastructure and commercial systems
            \item Security issues are introduced, leaking private data
        \end{itemize}
    \item Give a positive and bold statement of what this thesis is doing.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We present novel theoretical and practically applicable analytical tools to help analyse fault-prone systems
            \item We focus on making these tools easy to use, lowering the threshold for developers to use them in everyday life
            \item \textbf{If nothing else is remembered from the thesis, this should be it.}
        \end{itemize}
    \item The consequences of the thesis (preferably ``solve'' the problem in~\ref{item:pitch1})
        \begin{itemize}
            \item By applying the tools presented in this thesis to embedded real-time control systems, we can identify and mitigate a lot of trivial bugs and errors that occur.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Entering the digital age has forever changed how we interact with the world and how it interacts with us.
Unlike only 20 years ago, from the moment we wake up in the morning till the moment we close our eyes at night, we interact with advanced computer systems.
Our cellphones, work computers, and even our cars going to and from work contain a lot of computational devices.
To give an indication of how fast technology has advanced since the start of the millennium, we can look at the semiconductors\footnote{Semiconductors are components which constitute the foundation of generally \emph{all} electronic devices.} market share; in 2002 this was 141 billion US dollars, a number which have more than quadrupled to 614 billion US dollars in 2022~\cite{statista:2022}.

\textbf{The What:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Connectivity, Distributed systems, NCS, IoT, Wireless
    \item Communication hiccups
    \item packet drops
    \item deadline misses
\end{itemize}
}%

\nv{%
\textbf{The why:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Huge costs, damages
    \item Safety
    \item Security
    \item Paper by~\cite{Akesson:2020}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Control Theoretical Benefits}%

\nv{%
\textbf{The Statement:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Theoretical and practical tools for analysing and synthesising
        fault-tolerant controllers, with significant performance gains.
    \item Lowering the entry-level knowledge for applying the tools to real
        processes.
\end{itemize}
}%

\nv{%
\textbf{The Consequences:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decoupling and clarifying real-time and control theoretical models.
    \item Making them more accessible to a broader class of practitioners.
