\chapter{Background}%
\label{ch:background}%

This chapter presents the necessary background and motivation for the remainder of the thesis.
We divide the chapter in two primary parts.
First, a discussion on the real-time theoretical aspects is provided.
An extended introduction to how real-time operating systems operates is presented, e.g., processor sharing, task states, scheduling strategies, etc.
However, the main focus is dedicated to the most commonly used task models and their respective advantages and disadvantages, with respect to deadline overruns.
Additionally, we provide a brief discussion on state-machine applicability to the aforementioned task models. 
Next, the relevant control theoretical background is presented based on the theory of real-time systems.
Two different system modelling approaches are introduced: switching systems and Markov jump linear systems.
Both models are particularly relevant for real-time systems where the control task can overrun its deadlines.
Specifically for these systems, we present and discuss different stability and performance analyses.

\section{Real-Time Systems}%
\label{sec:background:rts}%
%
% A short extension to the RTS (and RTOS) precise objective
We begin with an introduction to real-time system fundamentals. 
The breadth of the topic prevents a comprehensive review of the existing literature to fit within the scope of this thesis.
In fact, real-time systems are all information processing systems which takes external input and operate on it within a predetermined deadline. 
This includes sensors, actuators, process control, machine vision, robotics, and health care systems, to acknowledge a fraction of all real-time systems.
Instead, we focus the attention to the elements which impact real-time control systems the most, i.e., RTOS fundamentals, periodic tasks, task models, scheduling policies, and execution models.
\question%
{
    Maybe the ``RTOS fundamentals'' should be ``CPU provisioning'' and ``memory management'' instead?
}{}
Since the RTOS is tightly interconnected with the hardware, it is natural to illustrate them jointly.
In Figure~\ref{fig:operating-system-abstraction}, the underlying hardware and real-time structure is expanded.

% CPU, cores, and threads
The \emph{central processing unit} (CPU, or simply \emph{processor}) is the electronic component responsible for executing the task functions.
Each function (or program) is translated into a list of instructions to be executed on the CPU.
These instructions belong to the machine's language used to tell the processor what type of operation to execute, e.g., load a specific memory registry or execute an arithmetic operation.
To execute the program instructions, the processor can contain one or more \emph{cores}, respectively denoting the processor as \emph{single-core} or \emph{multi-core}.
Each core can execute a list of program instructions; hence, the advantage of using multi-core processors (compared to single-core processors) is the increased number of instructions that can be executed in parallel. 
However, this gain comes at the cost of an elevated system complexity where the memory and application layout has to be adapted to the multi-core architecture~\cite{Brandenburg:2011}.
\question{mention something about ``\#hardware threads = \#cores'' here?}{}

% Memory
Integrated with the processor is usually a \emph{cache} memory, i.e., a small but fast memory that is easy to access from the operational cores.
The cache memory stores recently accessed instructions and data to reduce the latency induced by fetching from main memory.
Most modern CPUs have a layered cache memory hierarchy, where the smallest and fastest layer is denoted L1, the second smallest and fastest is denoted L2, and so on.


% Tasks (Task stats, and states)
%

% Scheduler (how it allocates resources), mechanisms, deadline handling, many paragraphs here probably

% GPIO 
% describe scheduler, tasks, contexts, task states, etc.

\section*{Embedded real-time control Systems}%
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refer to figure from Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} and then ``zoom'' in on the
        different aspects treated in the different subsections.
    \item Simple description of hardware components: Plant, Sensors, Network
        (wired/wireless), control hardware, actuators.
    \item Simple description of software components: network protocol, RTOS,
        tasks, memory, interrupts, etc.
    \item Maybe create a simple practical example (e.g., taxi of a plane) that
        can be followed throughout this section.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Real-Time Model}%
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start with a historical perspective
    \item Hard, Soft, Weakly-Hard, More expressive (\cite{Stigge:2011}), other?
    \item Describe advantages and disadvantages with each of the models
    \item recall great example of real-time system in rust book
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Modelling Execution using finite state-machine}%
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item This section should maybe be moved?
    \item Entire subsubsection requested by KE
    \item More automata theory
    \item "typically in control fsm have been used to design highlevel control
        (e.g., taxi takeoff and landing), in principle (computer science)
        automata have been used to represent more complicated things (for
        instance regular languages). This is the basis of what the WeaklyHard.jl
        does."
    \item Include markov theory here. "In CS when the transition was
        non-deterministic, i.e., probabilistic, then you have the concept of
        Markov chains."
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Control System Model}%
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start from plant, non-linear model, linearisation
    \item Sensors and actuator models included here.
    \item Control model (non-linear, more common ones), relate to real-time
        tasks
    \item Switching systems! Markov Jump Linear Systems!
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Stability Analysis}%
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Binary: Stable or not
    \item Stability definitions: nominal, MS, MSS, JSR, Lyapunov
    \item differences (e.g., JSR vs. Lyapunov), applicability
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Performance Analysis}%
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gradient: varying degree of performance
    \item Why Performance Analysis?
    \item Metrics
\end{itemize}
